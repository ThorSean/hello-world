# hello-world
My first repository 

My name is Sean and I am a human.

Do I have to type in html here?  It looks like I don't because this is a README file.  If this were a github website, then things may be dfferent.  I'd like to know where that distinction matters (since it's relevant to my current work.) 

I'm now going to just list a bunch of cities to play with formatting.

Atlanta

Barcelona

Chicago

Dusseldorf

Frankfort

Geneva

Halifax
